#### Description: Are you frustrated by applying numerical methods to endless iterations and still getting the wrong answer? Don’t worry, we have a solution!. We have created programs that will apply these methods for you and give you instant results We have made every effort to ensure that our programs are easy to use and effective in solving various kinds of problems. Numerical methods are techniques for solving mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically. They are widely used in engineering and science applications, such as optimization, interpolation, integration, differential equations, linear algebra, and more. However, implementing numerical methods can be challenging and time-consuming, especially for beginners. That’s why we have developed these programs using Python, a powerful and versatile programming language that is suitable for numerical computing.


The main purpose of this repository is to provide a learning resource for students and instructors of numerical methods courses. It can also serve as a reference for anyone who is interested in numerical computing and scientific programming.
